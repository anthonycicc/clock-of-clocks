A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qXePOz.

 A CSS only experiment based on this: http://goo.gl/49JZdd

The exported code makes me cringe, but eh... has a nice effect.

Known bugs:
- need a way to define the delay of the animation based on the unit (so the min triggers later than seconds).
